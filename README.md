# Spiritum Duo Docker
I have decided to take the Spiritum Duo and put it in containers!

## Overview
Ongoing work, but this repo will hold all of the work for the modular and open-source digital pathway. Initial work will be on the Glouecestershire lung cancer pathway, but this work would implemented so that other disease sites and trusts can benefit from this work
or actively on this project, and plan to expand the README file to make it easier to understand this program.

i will add more detail soon.

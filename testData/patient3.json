Current volumetric analysis is approximately 1987 mm3 compared with 2075 mm3 3 months previously. On axial images, it is fairly stable at 22 mm long axis. The degree of surrounding architectural distortion persists, but is also fairly stable.
        
        2. Allowing for non-contrast technique, no significant adenopathy or other pulmonary pathology has developed. Stable mediastinal appearances.
        
        3. Limited non-contrast subphrenic and skeletal appearances are unchanged also."

        An 8 mm short axis right submandibular lymph node is a little larger than on the previous study and demonstrates new modearte uptake (SUV max 3.9). This is equivocal, but in view of the suspeted dental patholgoy just above this, it is most likely reactive. 
        
        The irrefular elongated lesion in the left lower lobe apical segment measures 23 mm (previously measured at 18 mm) and remains midly avid (SUV max 2.7, previously 3.7).

Also noticed several firm masses have appeared on their torso. On examination today cachexic and shortness of breath walking into clinic. Heart rate 91, saturations 94% on air, BP 129/85. Diffuse wheeze. 2 x 3-4cm tethered firm masses to central chest wall and right abdomen. Living alone, not currently working. History of mild COPD - previously controlled with PRN salbutamol only."

        "result": "Due to the history of abdominal involvement, the CT was extended to include the abdomen and pelvis.
        
        Thorax: Large mass in the left axilla, about 84 mm. Additional subcutaneous masses in the axilla, overlying medial end of left clavicle, lower sternum and right axilla. Within the chest, a lobulated mass, 45 mm diameter, in the right lower lobe, contiguous with bulky right hilar lymphadenopathy stenosing the right lower lobe bronchus. Small peripheral area of atelectasis right lung base. Extensive emphysema in the upper lobes.
        
        Abdomen and pelvis: Multiple retroperitoneal masses tending to surround the kidneys, contributing to moderate right hydronephrosis. No primary renal tumour. Bilateral adrenal masses. Tumour masses in midline anterior to the bladder, involving the anterior abdominal wall and on the right posterior aspect of the bladder. Bulky right common iliac nodes. Additional substantial soft tissue masses in the subcutaneous regions of the right flank, left flank, and overlying both buttocks. Soft tissue nodules in the left inguinal canal. Liver, biliary tract and pancreas normal. No primary tumour arising from the gut.
        
        Skeletal review: No skeletal involvement or fracture.
        
        Conclusion: Widespread intrathoracic and intra-abdominal mostly retroperitoneal tumour, with multiple subcutaneous tumour nodules. Potential primary sites are lung, from the right lower lobe. This distribution of disease can also be found in metastatic melanoma."

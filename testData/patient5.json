        "name": "CT chest",
        "result": "1. Features suggest significant malignant relapse in the left upper lobe; difficult to measure accurately, but there is early occlusion of that lobes bronchus with lobulated heterogeneous malignant tissue arising from this, and invading the left upper mediastinal border, with a little narrowing of the distal pulmonary trunk and proximal upper lobe pulmonary artery, and small volume adjacent lymph nodes. Measures approximately 97 x 43 mm in axial dimensions. Some distal obstructive collapse identified, but there is a little tissue crossing the major fissure into the apical segment of the left lower lobe, although this was present previously.
        
        2. Significant N2 adenopathy, up to 8 mm right paratracheal and 19 mm at the subcarinal station. No supraclavicular or cephalic adenopathy is detected. Hazy 14 mm hypodensity in hepatic segment 5 is potentially metastatic, but probably long-standing on balance. 19 mm left adrenal nodule is also long-standing and unchanged. No convincing lymphangitis or malignant effusion, no pulmonary or destructive bone metastases identified.
        
        3. Allowing for nonprepared bowel technique, there is a little faecal loading, but no new or significant pathology is detected otherwise.
        
        Summary
        Features suggests significant malignant relapse/recurrence in the left upper lobe, provisional staging T4 N2 Mx (equivocal liver lesion)."

    "Positron emission tomography with computed tomography (procedure)": {
        "name": "PET-CT",
        "result": "There is a 65 mass in the left upper lobe which is intensely avid (SUV max 15.0). This is occluding the left upper lobe bronchus with associated complete collapse of the left upper lobe. THe mass is involving the left pulmonary artery. There is a separate pleural based 21 mm module in the medical left lung apex (SUV max 19.5).
        
        There are avid mediastinal nodes, for example there is a 21 mm avid subcarinal node (maximum SUV 17.3) and an adjacent avid node just inferior to the left main bronchus.
        
        Focal uptake in the right lung apex does nto correlate with corresponding abnormality on the CT component and liekly refelcts misreigstrered activity from a 9 mm node adjacent to the right brachiocephalic vein (SUV max 7.1). There are further avid right paratrachael nodes which, again, are misregistered (SUV max 10.1).
        
        Allowing for significant misregistration, no abnormal uptake is seen in the liver. The left adrenal nodule is not avid and is unchanged, in keeping with an adenoma.
        
        No new finding in the abdomen, pelvis, skeletal system of brain.
        
        Conclusion:
        Avid T4 left upper lobe tumour with N3 nodal disease and pleural-based metastasis in the left lung apex."

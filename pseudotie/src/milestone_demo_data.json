        "result": "Many thanks for seeing this patient. They have a 3-month history of increased shortness of breath on exertion. Otherwise, the patient has no other complaints and is working full time managing a supermarket. They are an ex-smoker having stopped 2 years ago. Chest X-ray showed a 12 mm right lung nodule. CT scan has confirmed a right apical lesion and this is felt to be consistent with a neoplasm. The patient's father unfortunately passed away from lung cancer. The patient themselves has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, osteoporosis and a previous cardioversion 2 years ago for atrial fibrillation. Current medications include a Spiriva inhaler, bisoprolol, aspirin, omeprazole, atorvastatin and alendronic acid."
